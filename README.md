## üåü Introduction

NoMQ is a modern IoT messaging protocol inspired by the simplicity of CoAP and the reliability of MQTT, but tailored for environments where minimal resource usage and maximum security are paramount. It leverages **AES-256-CBC** encryption, **HMAC-SHA256** authentication, and a robust Quality of Service (QoS) model to ensure secure and reliable communication in real-world IoT deployments.

### Why NoMQ?
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for low-memory devices (e.g., ESP32, ESP8266).
- **Secure**: End-to-end encryption and integrity protection.
- **Scalable**: Supports multiple devices and channels with prioritized messaging.
- **Brokerless**: Eliminates the need for heavy message brokers, reducing latency and complexity.
- **Real-World Ready**: Designed for industrial IoT, smart homes, and sensor networks.

## üéØ System Objectives

The primary objectives of NoMQ are to provide a messaging protocol that is:

1. **Secure**: Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity using state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques.
2. **Reliable**: Ensure message delivery with configurable QoS levels (0‚Äì3).
3. **Efficient**: Minimize resource usage (CPU, memory, and network) for constrained devices.
4. **Scalable**: Enable seamless communication in networks with multiple devices and channels.
5. **Flexible**: Support diverse IoT use cases, from smart homes to industrial automation.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

NoMQ follows a **layered architecture** to separate concerns and ensure modularity. The architecture is designed to balance security, performance, and ease of use.

### Architectural Layers
1. **Control Layer**:
   - Manages packet metadata (e.g., packet type, session ID, TTL).
   - Ensures protocol versioning and session persistence.
2. **Security Layer**:
   - Implements AES-256-CBC encryption for confidentiality.
   - Uses HMAC-SHA256 for integrity and authenticity.
   - Includes timestamps and IVs to prevent replay attacks.
3. **Data Layer**:
   - Handles payload encoding (JSON) and channel identification.
   - Supports variable-length payloads with efficient padding.
4. **Verification Layer**:
   - Validates packet integrity using HMAC-SHA256.
   - Ensures robust error handling for malformed packets.

### System Components
- **NoMQ Class**: Core protocol implementation with methods for subscription, publication, and packet processing.
- **UDP Socket**: Underlying transport layer for low-latency communication.
- **MicroPython Runtime**: Provides the execution environment for resource-constrained devices.
- **Wi-Fi Module**: Manages network connectivity with automatic reconnection logic.

## üì° Protocol Structure

NoMQ uses a well-defined packet structure to ensure efficiency and security. Each packet consists of four main sections: **Control Header**, **Security Header**, **Data Header**, and **Verification**.

### Packet Structure
| Layer            | Field                | Size (Bytes) | Description                                      |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Control**      | Magic Number         | 2            | Fixed value (`0xF1E2`) for packet identification |
|                  | Version              | 1            | Protocol version (`0x01`)                       |
|                  | Packet Type          | 1            | Type (Publish, Subscribe, Ack, Heartbeat, etc.) |
|                  | Flags                | 2            | QoS (0-3), Retain, Priority (0-15)              |
|                  | Packet ID            | 4            | Unique packet identifier                        |
|                  | Session ID           | 8            | Persistent session identifier                   |
|                  | TTL                  | 2            | Time-to-live for message expiration             |
| **Security**     | IV                   | 16           | Initialization Vector for AES-CBC               |
|                  | Timestamp            | 8            | Unix timestamp for replay protection            |
| **Data**         | Channel ID           | 16           | SHA256 hash of channel name                     |
|                  | Payload Length       | 4            | Length of encrypted payload                     |
|                  | Payload              | Variable     | Encrypted JSON data (AES-256-CBC)               |
| **Verification** | HMAC                 | 32           | HMAC-SHA256 for integrity and authenticity      |

### Packet Types
- `0x01`: Publish (send message to a channel)
- `0x02`: Subscribe (join a channel)
- `0x03`: Ack (acknowledge receipt)
- `0x04`: Unsubscribe (leave a channel)
- `0x05`: Heartbeat (keep session alive)

### Flags
- **Bits 0-1**: QoS (0: At most once, 1: At least once, 2: Exactly once, 3: Reserved)
- **Bit 2**: Retain (store message for new subscribers)
- **Bits 4-7**: Priority (0-15, higher value = higher priority)
- **Bits 8-15**: Reserved

## üöÄ Usage

### Example: Publish and Subscribe
```python
import uasyncio as asyncio
from nomq import NoMQ

async def main():
    # Initialize NoMQ
    device = NoMQ()
    
    # Subscribe to a channel
    device.subscribe("device/temperature/r2", priority=1)
    
    # Publish a message
    await device.publish("device/relay", "relay/03/off", qos=2, retain=True, priority=1)
    
    # Start listening for incoming messages
    await device.listen()

# Run the application
asyncio.run(main())
```

![test ](./docs/imgs/test.png) 

### Key Methods
- `subscribe(channel, priority)`: Join a channel with specified priority.
- `publish(channel, message, qos, retain, ttl, priority, ip, port)`: Send a message to a channel.
- `listen()`: Asynchronously receive and process incoming messages.
- `unsubscribe(channel)`: Leave a channel.
- `set_address(ip, port)`: Update the listening address.

## üåç Deployment in Real-World Scenarios

NoMQ is designed for a variety of IoT applications, including:

1. **Industrial IoT**:
   - Secure communication between sensors, actuators, and controllers.
   - Example: Monitor factory equipment and send alerts with high-priority messages.
2. **Smart Homes**:
   - Control devices like relays and lights with guaranteed delivery.
   - Example: Turn off a relay remotely with QoS 2.
3. **Sensor Networks**:
   - Collect data from distributed sensors in real time.
   - Example: Aggregate temperature readings from multiple devices.
4. **Research and Prototyping**:
   - Test lightweight communication protocols in academic projects.
   - Example: Simulate a mesh network with NoMQ.

### Deployment Tips
- **Security**: Replace default encryption and HMAC keys with unique, secure values.
